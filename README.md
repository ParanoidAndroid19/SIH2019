# Abstract

#### Existing Problems:
India has one of the highest numbers of maternal deaths. According to the UNICEF report, it is estimated that 44,000 women die due to preventable pregnancy-related causes in India.[1]â€¨


#### Main Idea:
In order to tackle the existing problem, the proposed solution acts as an effective tool providing right information at crucial time and services to the women at each stage of pregnancy. The proposed app has an easy to use user-interface, centred around animated medium of information that will encompass a large demographic, important information like contacts of relevant NGOs, health workers and nearby hospitals. The details regarding suitable government schemes will be available in the E-Seva portal.Essential information will be made available offline, communication can be established through SMS and push notifications.


#### Interfaces:

#### Technology Stack:
OS: Windows, Linux.
Open source libraries : Numpy , Scikit learn , matplotlib , pandas
Programming languages: Java(for android)
Compilation Tools: Android studio.


#### Working:
The proposed solution will have log-in screens for the women, PHCs, Doctor and health workers. The women can register themselves through a health worker or they can register on their own using unique ID like a phone number. If the women register themselves through a health worker, precautionary measures with a risk prediction system for severe maternal morbidity in patients using machine learning techniques like Decision tree, logistic regression can be provided along with the facility of a personalized pregnancy timeline otherwise they can access general pregnancy timeline. 

The users can watch informational animations/videos  on the themes of hygiene, sanitation, nutrition and pregnancy, they can also watch animations/videos without logging-in. The users will have a list of important contacts of nearby government hospitals, NGOs and their area health worker. They will receive regular reminders through notifications via SMS informing them of various important events like vaccinations and regular health check-ups.  Users can post and answer queries on community FAQ which will consist of doctors and PHC representatives. 

Doctors can upload the medical reports of the women to the Database which can be accessed  by the corresponding users , thus avoiding inconvenience caused due to misplaced reports. After covering a certain area the location will be pinned on the Google-map , thus digitally coordinate the activities of the workers and avoiding duplication of work reducing workload. Post-pregnancy vaccination alerts for infants will also be generated through SMS notifications. 


#### Animated Videos to spread awareness:



#### Features:
1. Voice enabled search to access various features of the app.
2. Awareness through animation with no language constraints.
3. Majority  of the app at user end will work without internet.
4. Animated nurse character will give regular suggestions/guidelines.
5. Prediction based on statistical data collected by health workers.
6. Calculation of hygiene index, by health worker.
7. Self-made animations to create awareness among women.
8. SOS button can be used during emergency for sending SMS alerts to the nearby registered users.
