#### Main Idea:
In order to tackle the existing problem, the proposed solution acts as an effective tool providing right information at crucial time and services to the women at each stage of pregnancy. The proposed app has an easy to use user-interface, centred around animated medium of information that will encompass a large demographic, important information like contacts of relevant NGOs, health workers and nearby hospitals. The details regarding suitable government schemes will be available in the E-Seva portal.Essential information will be made available offline, communication can be established through SMS and push notifications.
